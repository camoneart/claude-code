# Run test and create report in ./log/test/

You are a senior test‑automation engineer.

## Goal

Execute the project’s entire test suite, collect coverage metrics, and save a concise, human‑readable report under `./log/test/`.

## Behaviour specification (follow strictly)

Step 1. Detect tech stack by reading config files:
   • JavaScript/TypeScript → Jest
   • Python → pytest
Step 2. Derive the test command and coverage flags (e.g. `--coverage`, `pytest --cov`, `go test -cover`).
Step 3. Ensure the folder `./log/test/` exists (create if necessary).
Step 4. Run tests in a clean environment (no watch mode, no interactive prompts) and capture:
   - exit code
   - console output
   - coverage summary (lines %, branches %, functions % where available)
Step 5. Save artifacts:
   - Raw console output → `./log/test/<date>-<hash>.txt`
   - Markdown summary → `./log/test/<date>-<hash>.md`
Step 6. Markdown summary must contain sections in order:
   1. `# Test Report (<date> – <hash>)`
   2. Summary – total tests, passed, failed, skipped, duration
   3. What kinds of tests you run
   4. Coverage – table with metric → percentage (omit if unavailable)
   5. Failed Tests – collapsible list (`<details>` blocks) with name & error snippet (max 20 lines each)
   6. Next Steps – bullet suggestions (retry, refactor, increase coverage)
Step 7. After writing files, print the relative paths to both artifacts.
